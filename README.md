Artificial Intelligence Projects

This repository showcases a range of projects demonstrating my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and leveraging large language models (LLMs) to solve business problems efficiently.

# 1. Flight Route Optimization using Fine-tuned Large Language Models:
Fine-tuned OpenAI’s LLM on flight data to optimize travel routes.
Used prompt engineering techniques to develop a system that calculates the shortest travel time between origin and destination, considering schedules and layovers.
# 2. RAG Model for DC Itinerary:
Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using sentence transformers for embedding creation and FAISS for efficient retrieval.
Employed cosine similarity to retrieve relevant data and utilized OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate personalized 3-day itineraries for visiting Washington DC based on user queries.
This summary emphasizes my ability to integrate advanced machine learning techniques, efficient data storage, and LLMs to deliver intelligent solutions to real-world problems.
